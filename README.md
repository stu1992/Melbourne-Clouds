# Melbourne-Clouds
A timelapse application for the raspberry pi

I use this application to take pictures of the clouds outside my house. Providing both an almost realtime look as well as timelapses that I stitch together and upload to youtube
I've been working on this for the best part of a year. Much of it is legacy and aweful but it does the job so I have left it alone.
I initially put a timestamp on images but it takes the raspberry pi a very long time(40 seconds) to open a high definition image and write text to it. the code is still there but I have disabled it until I work out a way to ditribute the work to another host in a robust way.
I also have a light dependant resistor attached to the raspberry pi, which will alert the application when it's night time and the camera presets will change so you can see the stars in the sky
